What You're Aiming For

In this checkpoint, you are going to build FIFA player cards.

Instructions

Create a project using create-react-app.

Create a file called players.js, which is going to have an array of JSON Objects containing the player’s details (At least four players)
·        Be creative with your chosen players; you can choose whomever you like!

·        The attributes for each player are name, team, nationality, jerseyNumber, age, and an Image URL for the player.

·        Create a file called Player.js which contains the player component.

·        The Player component must render a react-bootstrap card. The card will display all attributes for each player defined in the players.js.

·        De-structure all the attributes for the Player component.

·        Create a component called PlayersList.js

·        Import inside the PlayerList.js, the Player component and the players’ data from players.js

·        Display all players inside the PlayerList.js, by mapping through all the elements in the array of players (check the .map function)

·        While mapping through the players pass in the props to the Player component (Search for the spread operator if you would like to use it)

·        Don’t forget to define default props for each attribute (Feel free to define any default props)

·        Use some inline styling for the Player component.

·        Import the PlayerList.js into the App.js (root component), and render the PlayerList.
